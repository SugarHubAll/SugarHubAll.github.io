        <p>This Bigo Live Privacy Policy explains how Bigo Live (“Bigo”, “we”,

            website
            (collectively, the “Bigo Services”).</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>We value the privacy of users, subscribers, publishers, members, and others who visit and use the Bigo
            Services
            (collectively or individually, “you” or “users”) and want you to be familiar with
            how we

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>You may share personal information when using the Bigo Services. One example is when you provide information
            about yourself as part of the Bigo account creation process. Another is when you take certain actions on the
            Bigo
            Services that are public or intended to be public in nature, such as when you broadcast content, post
            profile
            information, follow a channel, or subscribe to a broadcast channel. Given the social nature of some of the
            Bigo
            Services, that information may be collected, used, or disclosed by others who are part of that social
            interaction.
            In addition, some features of the Bigo Services are designed to provide others with information about user
            activity, such as identifying the user who created a particular Clip or the subscription status of users for
            a
            given channel. We encourage you to be mindful of this when considering your activity on the Bigo Services.

        <p>We value the privacy of users, subscribers, publishers, members, and others who visit and use the Bigo
            Services
            (collectively or individually, “you” or “users”) and want you to be familiar with

        <p>You may share personal information when using the Bigo Services. One example is when you provide information

            profile

            Bigo

            In addition, some features of the Bigo Services are designed to provide others with information about user

        <p>This Bigo Live Privacy Policy explains how Bigo Live (“Bigo” “we” “us”)
            process any personal data we collect from visitors and users of &nbsp;<a href="https://www.bigo.tv/">www.bigo.tv</a> and any applications, services provided in relation to the
            website
            (collectively, the “Bigo Service”).</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>We value the privacy of users, subscribers, publishers, members, and others who visit and use the Bigo
            Services
            (collectively or individually, “you” or “users”) and want you to be familiar with

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>You may share personal information when using the Bigo Services. One example is when you provide information
            about yourself as part of the Bigo account creation process. Another is when you take certain actions on the
            Bigo
            Services that are public or intended to be public in nature, such as when you broadcast content, post
            profile
            information, follow a channel, or subscribe to a broadcast channel. Given the social nature of some of the
            Bigo
            Services, that information may be collected, used, or disclosed by others who are part of that social
            interaction.
            In addition, some features of the Bigo Services are designed to provide others with information about user
            activity, such as identifying the user who created a particular Clip or the subscription status of users for
            a
            given channel. We encourage you to be mindful of this when considering your activity on the Bigo Services.

            it for

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>We may also retain certain information if necessary for purposes of safety, security, and fraud prevention.
            For
            example, if we deactivate a user’s account because of unsafe behavior or security incidents, we may
            retain
            certain information about that account to prevent that user from opening a new Bigo Live account in the
